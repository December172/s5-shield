 * s5-halt.efi — power the machine off from the FIRMWARE, with no kernel involved.
 *
 * WHY. In this project the rare case (the dGPU does not fall asleep and S5 would
 * come out at ~19 W) is covered by powering off from GRUB with `halt`: in THAT
 * boot no Linux kernel ever runs, the firmware does its own S5 with the hardware
 * exactly as POST left it, and the measurement comes out clean (1.05 W). On a
 * machine with systemd-boot there is no `halt` to be had, and this is the
 * equivalent: a three-instruction EFI application that systemd-boot starts like
 * any other entry, with `bootctl set-oneshot` to make it one-shot.
 *
 * WHY DOING IT FROM THE KERNEL IS NOT EQUIVALENT, which would be more convenient.
 * It has been measured and it is in docs/EVIDENCE.md: a module that calls
 * ResetSystem through EFI from a live kernel leaves S5 at 19.26 W, and writing
 * PM1a_CNT by hand without `_PTS(5)` or `device_shutdown()` leaves it at 26.56 W.
 * What saves the measurement is not "powering off through the firmware" but that
 * no kernel ever got to boot: that way the dGPU never wakes up and there is no
 * rail to cut.
 *
 * NO LIBRARY, ON PURPOSE: only the gnu-efi headers are used (the types and the
 * system table), not libefi or libgnuefi. It is thirty lines and there is nothing
 * a library would add here; in exchange, the same source builds through the TWO
 * known routes, which are not available on the same machines:
 *
 *   gnu-efi + objcopy with efi-app-x86_64   (the normal one; see efi/Makefile)
 *   clang --target=x86_64-pc-win32-coff + lld-link /subsystem:efi_application
 *
 * The second is the one needed when the distribution's binutils does not carry the
 * EFI target (check it with `objcopy --info | grep efi-app-x86_64`). On the machine
 * where this was written that is exactly the case, and clang+lld produces a valid
 * and smaller PE image. Both are documented in docs/systemd-boot-halt.md.
 *
 * ANTI-LOOP. It deletes the `LoaderEntryOneShot` EFI variable before calling
 * ResetSystem, as a second barrier: the first is the boot loader itself, which
 * consumes it when it uses the entry (measured on 2026-10-06: with the poweroff
 * already done, the delete here returned an error because systemd-boot had taken
 * it first). Both point at the same thing — if the firmware did not power off, or
 * if ResetSystem returned, the next boot is the normal one — and the entry's file
 * stays on the ESP on purpose: once the variable is consumed it is just another
 * menu entry, and uninstall.sh sweeps it, exactly as the GRUB branch already does
 * with its custom.cfg.
 *
 * SAY IT OUT LOUD. Everything that happens here is printed to the firmware
 * console, which is the only place anything can be recorded: in that boot there is
 * no kernel, so there is no journal, no dmesg, no witness. That is why the
 * run marker is written too (see marcar()).
 *
 * FAIL SAFE, ALWAYS. If there is no ResetSystem, or if it returns without powering
 * off, this returns EFI_SUCCESS and systemd-boot carries on with its menu and its
 * default entry: what is lost is that poweroff's saving, not the boot.
 *
 * SIGNING. With Secure Boot enabled the firmware only loads images signed by a key
 * it knows. This one has to be signed (bin/s5-halt-efi does it with sbctl if the
 * user's keys are where they are expected). Unsigned, systemd-boot will not load
 * it, stays in the menu and boots the usual thing: nothing breaks, but nothing is
 * saved either - which is why the installation checks it and says so.
 *
 * IT SHOWS ITSELF. Before powering off it writes the firmware's time into
 * `S5HaltLastRun` (its own GUID): a poweroff from the boot loader leaves no kernel
 * log, so without that marker there is no way to tell "the application ran" from
 * "the firmware rebooted and nobody noticed". `s5-halt-efi status` reads it and
 * `arm` deletes it, so what is read belongs to THIS run.
